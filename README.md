### Overview
This is a good project in learning how 'plumbing' works in terms of Object Oriented Programming. The premise to create a fleet of Jets in an airfield and display them in certain
ways depending on user input. We can list all of the jets return the fastest or longest flight. In the code we use An abstract base class of Jet to use as a blueprint to creat other
types of jets. And also we have some interfaces so that we can create not just vanilla jets, but specific jets that have special features.

### Things that I Learned
- Really what I learned was to take a breath step and and think and/or write down the specific problem I am trying to solve. This as in all OOP programming is a 'plumbing' problem
as I said earlier. The act of looping through an array or List and getting a specic data piece isn't that hard. It's knowing which piece goes where and how to retrieve it.
- As a software developer writing software is a craft. Everytime I code a project I work on writing better and more efficient code. But in a time crunch it's imprtant to not get
bogged down in the weeds instead of making the MVP function. So, this project I learned to ignore some of the things that I would normally spend more time on and spent more time
coding and helping others who had questions.
